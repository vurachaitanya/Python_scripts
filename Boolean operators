#Boolean operators aren't just evaluated from left to right. Just like with arithmetic operators, there's an order of operations for boolean operators:
#1. not is evaluated first;
#2. and is evaluated next;
#3. or is evaluated last.

bool_one = False or not True and True

bool_two = False and not True or True

bool_three = True and not (False or False)

bool_four = not not True or False and not True 

bool_five = False or not (True and True)

print bool_one bool_two bool_three bool_four bool_five
